# WCMU-WebCamMailUtility
A mail utility that supports send images snaphots on a scheduled basis from TrendNet Cameras

Older Trendnet cameras used to support emailing a snapshot from the camera on a regular schedule. As security standards improved the
software in the camera became obsolete. This utilitiy allows you to define a schedule and the utility will contact the camera, capture
an image and mail it. I run it on a very old generation one raspberri-pi, it pushes the pi to it limits but it works.

It requires node.js to be installed on the PI.
